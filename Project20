## MIGRATION TO THE Ð¡LOUD WITH CONTAINERIZATION USING DOCKER

In this project, I demonstrate the process of migrating an application from a virtual machine to containers using Docker. A VM infrastructure requires an OS for
the host server and an additional OS for each hosted application. Because containers all share the underlying OS, a single OS can support more than one container. 
The elimination of extra operating systems means less memory, less drive space and faster processing so that applications run more efficiently.
